# What is Method Overloading in Python?
# It is a form of Compile time polymorphism. In the case of method overloading, more than a single method belonging to a single class can share a similar method name while having different signatures. One can use method overloading for adding more to the behavior of concerned methods. A user wonâ€™t need more than one class for implementing it.

# Single Line Definition
# Method Overloading - A Function can be called with different number of arguments.
